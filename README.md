# sql-challenge
In this challenge I had to create an entity relationship diagram using Quick Database Diagrams. I establashed all the relationships and constraints then exported the schema. This schema was then loaded into pgAdmin to create the tables in the database I had already created. I then used copy statements to copy the data from the csv files given into the created tables. 
Once the tables were populated I was able to perform the analysis on it and came back with all the information.

I had an issue with loading data into the employee table because of date incompatiblity. The code was used to convert the data was provided by my Tutor from the Boorcamp's tutor sessions.
